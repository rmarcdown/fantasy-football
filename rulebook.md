# DAY 486 BOZ NO LEAN üòÇüíÄü•∫ FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE: OFFICIAL RULES DOCUMENT

## 1. Ownership

### 1.1 Ownership Standards

Being a team owner in the Bozwell Fantasy League is an honor and a privilege. You must uphold certain standards to remain a member of the league in good faith. These include, but are not limited to: timely payment, active participation, and upholding the integrity of the league.

### 1.2 League Membership Fee

Each member shall pay the league membership fee IN TOTAL by the night of the draft, the date of which is to be determined anew each year. If the fee is not paid by before the draft night, owners risk forfeiting their spot in the league.

The base league membership fee[^1] is set at **$50**. Additional fees may be tacked on if split equally amongst all owners and universally agreed upon. Additional fees might be added for the purchase of new communally used items and technology for the league.

### 1.3 Abdication

An owner can choose to abdicate their title and void league membership if they so desire, but this is strongly discouraged, and may result in a lifetime ban from the league. 

One should prepare for abdication over the offseason and inform all league members months in advance of the draft, as well as proposing a suitable successor to be voted on by all other owners. 

### 1.4 Removal

An owner can be removed if it is agreed upon by all other owners at any time during the season or offseason. Owners seeking another owner‚Äôs removal must present evidence to support said owner ‚Äúruining the integrity of the league‚Äù. If all other owners agree, said owner will be removed.

In the case of removal, a new owner shall be selected by the league‚Äôs commissioners and voted on by the owners. 

In the case of mid-season removal, the removed party‚Äôs team shall be managed by the commissioners. This team shall be barred from all trades and/or waiver activity during the conservatorship period.

### 1.5 Prizes

The league winner will receive $550 in addition to the Bozwell Belt, a WWE-style belt trophy. 

The league runner-up will receive $50 back, the total of their league buy-in. 

### 1.6 Punishments

The league loser of the 9-12 seed ‚Äútoilet bowl‚Äù shall reimburse the current owner of the Bozwell Belt for the cost to engrave the belt with next year‚Äôs winning team‚Äôs name and the cost of shipping the belt to the current champion (if applicable).

The previous champion and owner of the Bozwell Belt shall first send documentation of engraving and shipping costs to the group chat before requesting money from the league loser, who shall pay the engraver/shipper the cost of engraving and shipping as their punishment.

### 1.7 Rule Changes

All rule changes must be approved by a majority of owners, meaning at least 7 out of 12. Rule changes may be proposed at any time, but are only to be voted on during the off-season.

### 1.8 Owners

The current assortment of league owners is as follows, in alphabetical order by last name:

Marlowe Baker (Co-Commissioner)
Samuel Baumstein

### 2.2 Keepers

Before the season begins, each owner will have the option of retaining a maximum of **2** players from their previous season‚Äôs roster. Any roster transactions prior to the first day of league playoffs (Thursday) will be valid, but any players claimed from waivers following this date will not be valid keepers. 

Keepers must be chosen (or not) exactly one week prior to the draft for the relevant draft year. No changes of any kind to any team‚Äôs keepers are permitted during the week leading up to the draft.

For each player you choose to keep, you will sacrifice a pick depending on two factors: the round the player was originally drafted in, and how many years the player has been kept. Each player can be kept for a maximum of 3 years, after which they will be returned to the draft pool.

#### 2.2.1 Multi-year Keepers

**First year:** you lose a pick *in the round your player was originally drafted in.*
**Second year:** you lose a pick *one round lower than the round they were drafted in.*
**Third year:** you lose a pick *in a round half the value[^3] of the original draft round.*

Example: Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase was originally drafted in **Round 6** of the 2021-22 season.

He could be kept in the 2022-23 draft for a **6th-round pick**.	
He could be kept in the 2023-24 draft (for a second time) for a **5th-round pick**.
He could be kept in the 2024-25 draft (for a third and final time) for a **3rd-round pick**.
Now, in the 2025-2026 draft, he re-enters the draft pool. 
	
For a snapshot at who has most recently been kept and will be excluded from the draft pool, please reference this document: [Boz League Keeper Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q0OyCz3M3E524cPpngOt2yVhFEmGzjzJXayMmpPwAow/edit?usp=sharing)

### 2.3 Trades

Owners will have the ability to exchange players during the trade window (from immediately following the conclusion of the draft to the agreed-upon trade deadline). If a trade is made and agreed upon by two owners without foul play, it will be approved. All trades can be processed within 24 hours by commissioner approval. 

#### 2.3.1 Trade Deadline

Trades can be made immediately following the conclusion of the draft up until midnight of the final Wednesday of November, which will be our hard trade deadline. No trades are to be made or processed following this date.

#### 2.3.2 Trade Restrictions

No trades are to be made involving draft picks.

#### 2.3.3 Trading Keepers

Trading one's keepers is allowed, though after a trade, they maintain the same multi-year draft pick adjustments as they would have under one owner. After 3 years, regardless of when a keeper was traded, they re-enter the draft pool.

#### 2.3.4 Veto Power

If a trade is particularly egregious and/or one-sided, it can be vetoed and unilaterally reversed, so long as 7/12 owners vote in favor of overturning the trade. 

#### 2.3.5 Collusion

If an owner is found to have colluded in a trade, meaning that they have accepted/offered money to better their or another owner‚Äôs team, they shall be punished according to the following stipulations.

==***First offense: 3-year ban from keeping players.***==
==***Second offense: Permanently banned from the league.***==

The first offense resets after 3 years, meaning that a second offense would only kick in if committed during the 3-year ban period.

### 2.4 Waiver Wire

The waiver wire will start in reverse draft order. The owner will change following successful acquisitions, and owners will be sent to the bottom of the waiver if a claim is completed.

Following the first week, the waiver wire will reset at the conclusion of each week (Tuesday morning) to the inverse order of the current league standings.

### 2.5 Divisional Breakdown

The divisions were created in 2022 by rough location of each owner. The two divisions are: 

**The South division**
- Samuel Baumstein
- Edward Horwitz
- Dan Jaime
- Marc Rosenthal
- Zachary Schuler
- David Stark

**The North/West division**
- Marlowe Baker
- David Blecherman
- Roy Branitzky
- Jack Goldman
- Zachary Olgin
- Adam Safier

Divisions can be reordered if the league desires to create new divisions, though a majority of owners must support the proposed realignment.

## 3. Drafting

### 3.1 Draft Order

The draft order selection process is a two-part system. Each owner will first choose a horse racing in that year's Kentucky Derby who will then compete on the owner‚Äôs behalf. The owners will choose their delegate in quasi-reverse standings order[^4].

After the Kentucky Derby is complete, we will compile the order of the horses chosen by league owners. After matching each horse with their affiliated league member, this will be the draft order.

### 3.2 Draft Date and Time

The draft date will be chosen prior to the season and will generally take place in late August. If a time cannot be agreed on by all owners, then the draft shall take place at a time and date most convenient to a majority of owners.

## 4. Scoring

### 4.1 Scoring System

The league will follow ESPN‚Äôs full-point PPR scoring system. [Link to a detailed explanation of scoring](https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003914032-Scoring-Formats)

## 5. Playoffs

### 5.1 Playoff Qualification

At the end of the season, the top 8 teams will qualify for the playoffs. 

Divisions do not factor into seeding or playoff qualification, the teams with the top 8 records will all qualify. In the case of a tie, the tiebreaker is Total Points For.

### 5.2 ‚ÄúToilet Bowl‚Äù

The four teams who do not qualify for the playoffs will compete in the ‚ÄúToilet Bowl‚Äù, with the standings determining next year‚Äôs draft pick order selection.

[^1]: Accurate as of the 2025-26 fantasy season.
[^2]: 2 extra IR spots will be held on each roster for injured players, taking the total to 19 players in cases of injury.
[^3]: When halving an odd-numbered round, round up to determine the new round.
[^4]: The order is as follows: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 8th, 7th, 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 1st.
